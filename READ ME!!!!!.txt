# I recommend you should have around 100.000USD in robinhood acount before starting using this bot
# if you don't have that much money or you don't want to lose your money,
# open robinbot.py and find line 82 or # changing quantity depend on the latest price of stock
# delete the if elif statement from line 82 to 130
# or from '# changing quantity depend on the latest price of stock' to '# Buying stock if we have money'
# This will make the quantity of all your buying stock at 1.

# I have no responsibility for the lost of your money when using this trading bot
# when writing this bot, I'm at very young age, and don't have much knowledge in finance and programming.
